Pupillary light reflex (PLR)
================

Overview
----------
The pupillary light reflex task measures the response of the pupil to intermittent flashes of light on a dark screen.
The task consists of 2 blocks of 32 trials each. In each trial, the fixation is presented for ``6 s`` on a black 
background. After ``6 s``, the screen flashes white for ``75 ms``. The participant must gaze at the fixation cross
to trigger the trial.
