The Gap overlap task is meant to measure reaction times from a central stimulus to a
peripheral stimulus. A central fixation is first presented (Spinning clock). Then, a
peripheral stimulus is presented (Cloud). There are 3 alternating conditions: 

* Baseline condition:
    the central fixation disappears simultaneously with the
    presentation of the peripheral stimulus
* Gap condition:
    the central fixation disappears 200 ms before the presentation of
    the peripheral stimulus
* Overlap condition:
    the central fixation disappears 200 ms after the presentation of
    the peripheral stimulus


Finally, After the participant gazes to the peripheral stimulus, A reward animation
(A star) is presented at the same place as the peripheral stimulus. For half of the
trials, the peripheral stimulus appears on the left side of the screen. For the
remaining half, it appears on the right side of the screen.
